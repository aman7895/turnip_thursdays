# hungry

Our task today is to be hungry (hungry for knowledge, mostly). 

Problem: We have a scenario with a fridge where we can put food items, maintain a food recipe book and check if 
we have enough ingredients in the fridge to prepare those items.

### implement the following: 
- Add food items to the fridge
- Maintain a recipe book
- Check if a recipe can be prepared using the items in the fridge
    - If an item for a recipe is another recipe, then this condition should be handled as well
    - If half of the required items are a recipe, and the other half can be prepared using the ingredients, then this
    case should be handled as well. Ex: 2 Tomato sauce bottles are needed for a recipe: but we only have one, so
    we need to check if the other can be made using raw items.


Checkout `hungry.py` for my implementation and feel free to point out corrections!
