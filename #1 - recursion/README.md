I wrote out some basic recursion code to explain it from the ground level for basic understanding. The idea is quite simple - we need a base case and a cursive case to make sure our function ends at the right time, doesn't time out and finds the desired result.

You can refer to `recursion.py` for a basic idea and then I implemented a slighly advanced (beginner level DFS problem) version in the other file - `binary_tree_path_sum.py`.

Feel free to suggest edits and raise a PR!
