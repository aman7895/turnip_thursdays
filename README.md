# turnip_thursdays

A space that I will be updating every Thursday with something interesting I find over the week. 

Topics could range from multiprocessing to recursion to dynamic programming to generators to what-not. It's just a way to finally implement the million Medium articles I have read over the past year. 

Why turnip? Well I thought I could turn it up a bit, and then turnip was the closest match.
